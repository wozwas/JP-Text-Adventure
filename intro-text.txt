Two days ago you were just a world renowned paleobotanist, 
on a dig site in the badlands of Montana with the love of 
your life, digging for dinosaur bones and fossilized plant 
life.  Now you're running for your life from the same 
creatures you saw buried under millions of years of rock, 
brought back to life by a greedy corporation to be used 
in an amusement park!

The power in the park is out, and with the help of the head 
game keeper you've made it to the maintenance shed, in the 
hopes of rebooting the grid system and restoring order.  
All you need to do now is navigate through the maze of 
cables and pipes, to find the switch panel and get things 
back online!

You're in a dark room, a metallic mesh floor underneath your
feat, having just closed the door to the outside behind you.  
In your right hand is a flashlight, and in your left a walkie 
talkie, your only way of communicating with your colleagues 
back at the visitors lodge.  They should be able to guide you 
to your destination, but you know the real truth is...

you're on your own...
